# Nasa Daily Pick
### Created by: [Amy Rippeto](https://github.com/aripp2)

## Objective
This was a final project as a student in the Front End Engineering program at Turing School of Software and Design. I was tasked with creating a simple one page application utilizing the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). The challenge was to build the application in **Vue.js**, a framework we were not taught.

This application allows the user to view NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day and the images from the current month. I enjoyed learning **Vue.js** and look forward to expanding my knowledge and experience.
